**Warning: this repository was previously prepared for an academic assessment!**

This repository was made public after the end of my academic assessments to provide a personal showcase for my past work, with the understanding that the topic and nature of the assessment would change every year. In the unlikely event its contents becomes relevant to any current academic assessment, they should not be used **under any circumstances** for such an academic purpose. 

This warning was added after a recent event at the time of writing, despite the content of this repository not being involved in any way.
